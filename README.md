# Explainable Anomaly Intelligence using CADEN - Contextual Anomaly Detection and Explanation Narrative

CADEN is a decision intelligence framework that transforms raw anomaly signals into
clear, actionable narratives for business stakeholders.

## Key Capabilities

- core/        → CADEN pipeline stages
- utils/       → configuration & helpers
- data/        → synthetic datasets (optional)
- main.py      → pipeline entry point

## Status
Research / prototype implementation.
